#### I won't pinpoint a student to lead the prayer

* Student don't refuse, but may not have the ðŸ’–
* When I enter the live class session, if the Holy Spirit moves you to pray, go ahead

> As she kept on praying to the Lord, Eli observed her mouth.
> Hannah was **praying in her heart**, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard.  
\-<span style="color: brown; font-size: 0.75em">1 Samuel 1:12-13</span>



### Pray from the heart, doesn't have to be English

> <sup>7</sup> When you pray, donâ€™t babble on and on as the Gentiles do. 
> They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again.
> <sup>9</sup> Pray like this:
> 
> Our Father in heaven....

### LEARN THE HARD WAY

![hard](images/hard.png)

+ try not to open past exercises when practicing
  - or if you need to, just don't copy and paste lazily



### PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE

<div style="display: flex">
  <img src="images/kata.png" style="width: 50%">
  <ul>
    <li><b>Do</b> the problem sets</li>
    <li>Even if they are a <b>LOT</b></li>
    <li>This sem we'll try
      <ul>
        <li>50% basics - solve these for a 3.0 equivalent</li>
        <li>25% average - solve ðŸ‘† and these for a 2.0 equivalent</li>
        <li>25% difficult - solve ðŸ‘† and these for a 1.0 equivalent</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>



### GO THE EXTRA MILE

+ fast learners will have lots of extra time
  - don't be idle and waste time
  - learn beyond what's required
    + make sure you **100%** understand what you learn in advance

ASK QUESTIONS
=============

* There are no stupid questions, **don't be shy**.
  - FUN FACT:  Students that ask lots of questions have an 80% chance to get **1.0**.



ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
==================

**Absolutely no to cheating in my classes**



> Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.  
\-<span style="color: brown; font-size: 0.75em">Luke 16:10</span>

> Whoever walks in integrity walks securely,
> but whoever takes crooked paths will be found out.  
\-<span style="color: brown; font-size: 0.75em">Proverbs 10:9</span>

|----------------------------|-----------------------------|



#### If you don't get caught
* it will still backfire, one day when working, you'll have no one to copy from
  - remember Prov 10:9, you **will** be found out
* only ~8% of PH grads can pass Stacktrek's exam for applicants
  - they graduated but can't pass a **basic** coding exam?
* but there's Google!
  - a bank in our country got hacked, for copying, **without understanding** -- StackOverflow code
    snippets that is neither meant to be complete nor secure, but just illustrates an idea
