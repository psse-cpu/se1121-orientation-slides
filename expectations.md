#### I won't pinpoint a student to lead the prayer

* When I enter the live class session and request someone to pray, just volunteer
  through the leading of the Holy Spirit
  - volunteering usually leads to prayers that are **sincere**

> As she kept on praying to the Lord, Eli observed her mouth.
> Hannah was **praying in her heart**, and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard.  
\-<span style="color: brown; font-size: 0.75em">1 Samuel 1:12-13</span>



### <span style="color: #34A56F">Do:</span>Pray from the heart, doesn't have to be English

> <sup>7</sup> When you pray, donâ€™t babble on and on as the Gentiles do. 
> They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again.
> <sup>9</sup> Pray like this:
> 
> Our Father in heaven....  
\-<span style="color: brown; font-size: 0.75em">Matthew 6:7,9</span>

  - it doesn't had to be perfect grammer, other countries more progressive
    but there English are not wery goot.
  - always strive to recite, chat, ask questions, or help someone else in English 
    (live class, Discord)



### <span style="color: #34A56F">Do:</span> LEARN THE HARD WAY

![hard](images/hard.png)

+ try not to open past exercises when practicing
  - or if you need to, just don't copy and paste lazily



### <span style="color: #34A56F">Do:</span>  PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE

<div style="display: flex">
  <img src="images/kata.png" style="width: 50%">
  <ul>
    <li><b>Do</b> the problem sets</li>
    <li>Even if they are a <b>LOT</b></li>
    <li>Usual breakdown:
      <ul>
        <li>50% basics - solve these for a 3.0 equivalent</li>
        <li>25% average - solve ðŸ‘† and these for a 2.0 equivalent</li>
        <li>25% difficult - solve ðŸ‘† and these for a 1.0 equivalent</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
==================

**<span style="color: red">Don't:</span> cheat**



> Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.  
\-<span style="color: brown; font-size: 0.75em">Luke 16:10</span>

> Whoever walks in integrity walks securely,

##### Coding is thinking, not copying <!-- .element style="font-size: 0.65em" -->

|----------------------------|-----------------------------|



#### If you don't get caught
* it will still backfire, one day when working, you'll have no one to copy from
  - remember Prov 10:9, you **will** be found out
* only ~8% of PH grads can pass Stacktrek's exam
  - they graduated but can't pass a **basic** coding exam?
* but there's Google!
  - a bank in our country got hacked, for copying, **without understanding** -- StackOverflow code
    snippets that is neither meant to be complete nor secure, but just illustrates an idea



#### If you're stuck, show your code to get help

#### If you're stuck on a quiz or exam

Treat *new normal* quizzes and exams as **proctored**



### <span style="color: #34A56F">Do:</span> love your course

One SE batch has a favorite quote:

> For the love of SE! ðŸ’“ðŸ’“ðŸ’“

- When there's love, there's pain ðŸ˜‰
  - [Language reflects culture](https://medium.com/@lucas.po/our-peoples-tongue-the-history-and-future-of-the-hokkien-language-in-the-philippines-414e0628932f). 
    In the Min Nan (a.k.a. Hokkien) dialect  spoken by most Chinoys, love and
    pain are both the same words: ç–¼ (tia<sup>n</sup>)
