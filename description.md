### What is it?

* This course focuses on object-oriented programming (OOP).

### What is it?

* Solve a problem by modelling real-world objects in your code.
* Mainstream programming style (formally called a **paradigm**)
* 8 of the 10 programming languages in the TIOBE Index Top 10 are primarily OOP
  - as of July 2020
  - TIOBE rankings change from time to time



### What language?

* Java is used in most traditional OOP courses
* CPU SE is **not** traditional, so let's use a hipster language from Google

### What we'll learn? (1/7)

![single-class](images/single-class.png)

Represent/mimic/**model** a single, real-world object inside our code.



### What you'll learn? (2/7)

![never-again](images/again.jpeg)

OOP is easy-to-learn, but difficult-to-master. It's easy to go astray.  We'll learn _principles_ and 
_best practices_ along the way



### What you'll learn? (3/7)

![inheritance](images/inheritance.png)

Some of these objects are similar (all these animals breathe), but they do have slight differences.
We can model them in our OOP code too.



### What you'll learn? (4/7)

![composition](images/petshop.png)

Build big objects that are **compose**d of smaller objects.  A
petshop is made up of pets, the veterinarian, shelves, customers, pet food, etc.



### What you'll learn? (5/7)

![exceptions](images/stopped.jpg)

Things that can go wrong in our apps are also objects ðŸ˜®, they're heavy, they get **throw**n around, 
and will crash our apps if we don't **catch** 'em.



### What you'll learn? (6/7)

![docs](images/docs.png)

When our app has now 1337 different kinds of objects, our brains will melt.  We'll learn some
notations to give us bird's eye views of how these objects interact.



### What you'll learn? (7/7)

![gui](images/gui.jpg)

CLI apps get boring after a while, but your next Uber for Sardines startup idea
needs a GUI right?  You'll build a mobile app or game for your final project.
